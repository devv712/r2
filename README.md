Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel machine learning approach enabling decentralized model training while safeguarding data privacy. Unlike traditional centralized methods, FL mitigates privacy risks by retaining data on local devices, addressing challenges such as data security, regulatory compliance, and data heterogeneity. This study highlights FLâ€™s principles, privacy-enhancing techniques, and applications across sectors, emphasizing its alignment with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Case studies and data visualization tools like Orange illustrate the opportunities and challenges in developing privacy-preserving FL systems.
